= OpenAPI Diff Tool Gradle Plugin

== Introduction
The
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff[OpenAPITools Diff Tool] is useful in comparing 2 specifications. As part of the original repository a maven plugin is included but for those of us that prefer Gradle there was no plugin to be found. This repository contains the code to implement such a plugin.



The plugin has been implemented with an Extension, allowing for the configuration options to be passed in a block assigned with "openapi_diff", and can be used in the build.gradle file

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.openapi_diff'
}

openapi_diff {
    originalFile = "old_specification.yaml"
    newFile = "new_specification.yaml"
}
----

The functionality can also be used by creating a task in the build.gradle similar to

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.openapi_diff'
}

task triggerCompatible(type: com.x3t.gradle.plugins.openapi.OpenapiDiffPluginTask){
    originalFile = "old_specification.yaml"
    newFile = "new_specification.yaml"
}
----

== Building & Testing

=== Build
To build the plugin you can use the standard Gradle commands of

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew jar
----

To publish to your local maven repository

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publish
----

If the version is set with "-SNAPSHOT" it will automatically publish locally to a sub-directory called repo.

=== Local Testing

To perform testing local you can run the Gradle build in the demo sub-directory. This will use the ./repo directory to source the plugin for testing.

Another way to test the plugin is to run the following from the root directory.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew test functionalTest
----

This will run JUnit tests and will trigger TestKit tests with the functionalTest task.

== Publish Plugin

To publish the plugin you need to

. Ensure the API key and secret, for x3tadmin, have been added to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
. The version string has been updated to remove "-SNAPSHOT" and is greater than the last published version.

You then need to open a terminal and run

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishPlugins
----
